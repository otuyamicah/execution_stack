    <h3>Brief Intro of barbing-Your experience:</h3>

    <p>Barbing in my own view is another branch of Artistry,
        in which a barber"s clipper becomes his painting brush
        while the client hair becomes his Canvas:
        with my experience so far in barbing,
        i have come to realize that in time,
        there is a relationship both the barber and client develop with each other
        that is most of time unexplainable,
        it actually becomes more like a family-bond
        that last almost for ever if nutured with care and understinding.
